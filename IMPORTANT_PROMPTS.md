## Data Classification & Storage

### Issue: "Priyanka likes apple" responded with "gotcha, you like apple"
**Problem**: System was incorrectly assigning other people's data to the user
**Solution**: Fixed data extraction and response generation to properly distinguish between user's own data and other people's data
**Key Changes**:
- Enhanced `fallbackExtraction` method in `data-extraction-service.js`
- Updated `generateResponseMessage` to use correct person names
- Fixed regex patterns for other people's preferences

### Issue: Data getting entangled between user and other people
**Problem**: User's data and other people's data were being mixed up
**Solution**: Improved data classification logic
**Key Changes**:
- Enhanced person detection in data extraction
- Fixed response generation to use correct person names
- Improved data storage with proper person classification

---

## Question Detection

### Issue: "What does Priyanka like?" treated as statement instead of question
**Problem**: Questions about other people's data were being treated as statements
**Solution**: Added regex patterns for other people's questions
**Key Changes**:
```javascript
// Added to gemini-service.js isDataQuestion method
/what\s+does\s+(\w+)\s+like/i,
/what\s+do\s+(\w+)\s+like/i,
```

## Delete Functionality

### Issue: Pinecone delete operation failing with filter syntax error
**Problem**: `PineconeBadRequestError: illegal condition for field filter`
**Solution**: Replaced filter-based deletion with ID-based deletion
**Key Changes**:
```javascript
// Old (broken)
await this.index.deleteMany({
  filter: { phoneNumber: { $eq: phoneNumber } }
});

// New (working)
const userData = await this.retrieveUserData(phoneNumber);
const vectorIds = userData.map(item => item.id);
await this.index.deleteMany(vectorIds);
```

### Issue: "Delete data" command treated as name update
**Problem**: Delete command was being processed after name update logic
**Solution**: Moved delete command check to highest priority
**Key Changes**:
- Moved delete command check to beginning of conversation state
- Added priority handling for delete commands

---

## Name Collection Logic

### Issue: Any data added asked to update name
**Problem**: In `waiting_for_name_response` state, ANY message was treated as name update
**Solution**: Added smart name detection logic
**Key Changes**:
```javascript
const isNameLike = messageText.toLowerCase().includes('name') || 
                  messageText.toLowerCase().includes('i am') || 
                  messageText.toLowerCase().includes('i\'m') ||
                  /^[A-Za-z\s]+$/.test(messageText.trim()) && messageText.trim().length < 50;
```

---

## Model Configuration

### Issue: Gemini model not found error
**Problem**: `gemini-1.5-flash` model not found (404 error)
**Solution**: Changed to `gemini-pro` model name
**Key Changes**:
- Updated `data-extraction-service.js`
- Updated `gemini-service.js`
- Changed from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-pro`

---

## Database Storage

### Issue: System using local storage instead of database
**Problem**: Pinecone not configured, falling back to local storage
**Solution**: Enforced database-only storage
**Key Changes**:
- Removed all local storage fallbacks
- Added auto-creation of Pinecone index
- System now requires `PINECONE_API_KEY` to function

---

## Response Generation

### Issue: Delete data confirmation message
**Problem**: Basic delete confirmation was not informative
**Solution**: Enhanced confirmation message
**Key Changes**:
```javascript
'🗑️ All your data has been deleted successfully!\n\n✅ Your personal information, preferences, and all stored data have been permanently removed from the database.\n\nYou can start fresh by providing new information whenever you\'re ready.'
```

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Priority Order Matters**: Delete commands must be checked before other logic
2. **Data Classification**: Proper person detection is crucial for data organization
3. **Question vs Statement**: Clear distinction needed between questions and statements
4. **Database Requirements**: System should enforce database configuration
5. **User Experience**: Clear error messages and confirmations improve usability
